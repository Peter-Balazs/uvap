Fall detection in elderly care homes.

The system uses two 3D-calibrated cameras per room and runs human body
pose estimation. Based on the body pose, fallen body pose can be
recognized. An alert is sent to the staff in real-time. Staff personals
can look at the alert, validate the images and decide to take action.
