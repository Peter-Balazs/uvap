# Head Pose Demo

This section demonstrates the setup and usage of the [3D Head Pose] feature.

The demo plays video from a JPEG topic and visualizes the head pose:

â€” see the illustration below._

## Prerequisites

Before starting the demo ensure the following:

* UVAP is installed as instructed in [Setting Up UVAP]
* UVAP is configured in `base` demo mode as instructed in [Configuring UVAP for Base Demo Mode]
* The following microservices are running:
  * [Multi-Graph Runner]
* Web display is started as instructed in [Starting Web Player].

Required topics:

* `base.cam.0.original.Image.jpg`
* `base.cam.0.dets.ObjectDetectionRecord.json`
* `base.cam.0.poses.HeadPose3DRecord.json`

## Start Head Pose Demo
   
Start the demo with `run_demo.sh`:
   
   ```
   $ "${UVAP_HOME}"/scripts/run_demo.sh --demo-name head_pose \
     --demo-mode base -- --net uvap
   ```
   
   >**Note:**  
   After the first run of these scripts it is recommended that `set_retention.sh script`
   is executed manually because new (`*.Image.jpg`) topics are created. For
   further information, see [Setting the Retention Period].
