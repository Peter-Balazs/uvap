# Notations of the UVAP Documentation


Lines with monospace font starting with `$` (dollar) signs are to be executed. 
The `$` (dollar) sign
itself should not be copied into the terminal. 
Lines starting with `something$` and `something#` are to be treated as
`$` lines, only the folllowing part should be copied. 
For example: `<DOCKER># command-to-run`.

If a command is broken into multiple lines, you will see `\` (backslash) at the end of each line. All
such lines must be copied together. 
There will be no `\` (backslash) at the end of the last line. 
For example:
```
$ command-to-run argument1 argument2 \
  argument3 argument4
```
