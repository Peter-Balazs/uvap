# Image Streams

The _Image Streams_ feature saves video frames as images. Saved images can be
used for the visualization of UVAP features in demos or other applications,
and for re-running the analysis after a configuration change.

This feature is provided by **Multi-Graph Runner (MGR)**.
For further information, see [MGR].
