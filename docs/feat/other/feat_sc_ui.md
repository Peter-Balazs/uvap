# Stream Configurator

**Stream Configurator** is an easy-to-use tool for _passline_ creation and
management (for example, importing and exporting passlines) in UVAP.

Passlines are directed polylines defined in the **Pass Detector** microservice
configuration, see [Configuring Pass Detector]. These lines help
detecting if an individual enters or leaves an area of interest.

>**Note:**  
**Stream Configurator** is optimized for Google Chromeâ„¢ browser.

For further information, see [Starting Stream Configurator UI]. See
the [Stream Configurator UI Guide] for further information on the settings
and usage of the Stream Configurator UI.
