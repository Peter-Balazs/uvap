# Pass Detection

The _Pass Detection_ feature detects whether a detected person crossed a line
drawn on a video frame. The position of the line can be configured. This feature
depends on the _Tracker_ feature. _Pass Detection_ provides basic data for
higher level services, such as people counting or measuring dwell time.

This feature is provided by UVAP **Pass Detector** microservice.
For further information, see [Pass Detector].

For a quick example setup of the _Pass Detection_ feature, see the [Demo].
