# Anonymization

The _Anonymization_ feature saves video frames as anonymized images. Saved images
can be used for visualization of UVAP features in demos and other applications
while adhering to data privacy regulations. Because of the anonymization, these
images cannot be used for further analysis. The anonymization process usually
depends on the _Head Detection_ feature as it blurs the extended bounding box of
a detected head.

The _Anonymization_ feature is provided by **Multi-Graph Runner (MGR)**.
For further information, see [MGR].
