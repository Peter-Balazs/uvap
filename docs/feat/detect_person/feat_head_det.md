# Head Detection

The _Head Detection_ feature of UVAP identifies the head of a person on video
frames and saves the position of the bounding boxes of the identified head.
This feature can be used to detect if people are present in an area.  
_Head Detection_ is a fundamental feature for higher level UVAP solutions.

This feature is provided by **Multi-Graph Runner (MGR)**.
For further information, see [MGR].

For a quick example setup of the _Head Detection_ feature, see the [Demo].
