/**
 Configuration for kafka_reid.

 Input:
   Inputs are streams of feature vectors or clusters that may be extracted from
   - video camera streams, via feature vector extraction and optionally pre-clustering
   - person databases containing images
   Inputs can be any record type that contains either a FeatureVector or a FVCluster field.
   Camera input streams can be used for registration, reidentification, or both.

 Reidentification:
   Feature vectors are reidentified as an existing identity when they are similar enough to
   a registered feature vector cluster.
   Each stream that is used for registration will provide a top list of matches, the final result will be
   the concatenation of these top lists.
   Each top list has a maximum size configured for that reidentification stream (max_num_matches).
   A top list can be shorter if there are not enough matches reaching the minimum required score (min_similarity).

 Registration:
   The configuration for the clustering algorithm is the same as ClusteringConfig above.
   Feature vectors from camera streams are registered, i.e. stored as a new identity (cluster) when they are dissimilar
   to any other stored cluster.
   Feature vectors from a person database are registered by their kafka message key,
   which can be e.g. the name of the person.

 Outputs: ReidRecord and optionally an undocumented internal state topic
